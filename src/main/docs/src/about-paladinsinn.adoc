Hi, I'm Roland T. Lichti, known in most internet communities as klenkes74.
Paladins Inn is my side project.
I use it to promote role playing games, especially Torg Eternity.
This software system, the DCIS (Delphi Council Information System) should support playing Torg Eternity.
It provides a game registration system where game masters can create tables to offer game sessions to players.
Also it tries to create a shared campaign with a shared timeline and a scoring system to give the players and game masters agency to steer the campaign.
