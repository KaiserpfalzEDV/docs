=== Quality Scenarios

[options="header",cols="1,9a"]
|===
| ID | Scenario

|[[FS01,Tailored to Torg Eternity (FS01)]] **FS01** {fs01-index}
|The system is created for enabling Torg Eternity Games.

|[[FS02,Game Session Organization (FS02)]] **FS02** {fs02-index}
|The software should support in planning, running game sessions.

|[[FS03,Shared Campaign (FS03)]] **FS03** {fs03-index}
|The software should create a shared campaign with a shared timeline following the Torganized Game (((Torganized Game))) concept.

|[[CO01,Compatible with FoundryVTT (CO01)]] **CO01** {co01-index}
|The data transfer to FoundryVTT based modules should be as seamless as possible.

|[[CO02,Compatible with Torg-Codex (CO02)]] **CO02** {co02-index}
|The data from DCIS which is compatible with the Torg-Codex (((torg-codex))) should be included in the Torg-Codex.

|[[US01,Web based (US01)]] **US01** {us01-index}
|The main interface should be web based.

|[[US02,FoundryVTT Module (US02)]] **US02** {us02-index}
|The system should have API to support specialized FoundryVTT modules.

|[[RE01,Working hours 24/7 (RE01)]] **RE01** {re01-index}
|Torg Eternity is played around the world. So the systems have to work 24/7. There is no maintenance window available where no users would be affected.

|[[EF01,Fast Response Times (EF01)]] **EF01** {ef01-index}
| Request have to be answered quickly. The following time percentiles are sufficient:
[options="header",cols="1,1"]
!===
!No. of messages!Response Time
!95%!1,5s
!90%!2s
!75%!2,5s
!50%!4s
!25%!5
!===

|[[MT01,Small Team (MT01)]] **MT01** {mt01-index}
|Maintaining the software and the data must be possible for a small team (basically the full army of myself, me, and I).
