## Abstract

This project contains the arc42 description for the whole DCIS system.
It is created as white paper containing the target system description.
But during implementation it will evolve into the macro architecture document of the DCIS system.

## License

The license for the software is LGPL 3.0 or newer.

## A note from the author

If someone is interested in getting it faster, we may team up.
I'm open for that.
But be warned: I want to do it _right_.
So no short cuts to get faster.
And be prepared for some basic discussions about the architecture or software design :-).
