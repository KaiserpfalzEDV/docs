= JSR-223 Scripting Integration

JSR-223 (link:https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=223[Java Specification Request 223]) is a specification for the Scripting API for the Java platform.
It enables integration of scripting languages into Java applications and offers the following advantages:

Language Independence::
Uniform API for various scripting languages (JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Groovy, etc.)

Dynamic Execution::
Scripts can be loaded and executed at runtime

Bidirectional Access::
Java code can access script objects and vice versa

Standardized Integration::
Part of the Java standard since Java 6

Template engines with JSR-223 support can be integrated into various Java applications through this interface without requiring specific adapters.
This allows for more flexible integration across different frameworks and use cases.
